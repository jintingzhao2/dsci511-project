# Healthcare Associated Infections in Hospitals by Income Trends
#DSCI511-project
Final Project by Group 5
By Stefanie Jackson, Jonas Ventimiglia and Jin Ting Zhao

#Introduction:
This dataset includes U.S. hospitals along with their Healthcare-Associated Infection (HAI) scores and related measures, geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), and county-level poverty rates. It was created to support analysis of how hospital infection outcomes relate to community socioeconomic factors. The 

#Purpose
The purpose of this dataset is to help identify patterns in infection disparities—for example, whether hospitals serving lower-income communities tend to have higher HAI scores—while also highlighting areas where additional infection prevention resources may be needed. It enables quality improvement teams to benchmark infection performance against hospitals serving similar patient populations, rather than only well-resourced facilities, and supports geographic visualization of infection burden across counties or census tracts to inform local public health efforts.
